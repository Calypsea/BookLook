<h2>The Idea:</h2>

<p>BookLook is a personal project, created to practice my knowledge of React, React
router, TypeScript, Firebase database and authentication skills. It allows users to look 
up books that exist on the Google Books API and favourite them while using their
personal account. </p>

<p>The data required to register is only saved in my cloud firebase, and will not
be used in any way shape of form outside of this project. Authentication within this
project was implemented purely so i could learn and familiarise myself with it's functions. </p>
