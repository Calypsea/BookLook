<p>This <a href="https://calypsea.github.io/BookLook/">website</a> is my deep dive into learning and understanding TypeScript and React Router.</p>

It is a website that allows the user to find and enjoy various books. As an avid book reader myself, i decided to create something i could see myself using in the future. Currently the website has two simple book searches implemented, one for people that know what they want, and another one that allows you to put in some genres only, to not overwhelm someone that might be new to books.

<b>In the near future, i plan to implement:</b>

• A way to favourite books and keep them in a different tab
• Some sort of authentication system
• Ability to put in a book title and get similar book suggestions
